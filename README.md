Request Management System (BST + MaxHeap)


 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview 

This project implements a Request Management System by combining two fundamental data structures:

- Binary Search Tree (BST) â€” used for storing request records (ID and Name)
- Max Heap â€” used for managing request priorities efficiently

It provides a command-line interface that allows users to interactively manage and process requests based on their priority levels.

- Insert new requests (ID, Name)
- Search for a request by ID
- Delete requests by ID

 ðŸ”· Max Heap: 
- Insert requests with a given priority
- Delete requests by ID
- Increase the priority of an existing request
